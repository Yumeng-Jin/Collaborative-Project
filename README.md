### Collaborative-Project
Driven by the shared passion and interest in Web-scraping and Machine learning, we performed two collaborative projects.  
- Project 1 provides valuable insights for recruiters and job seekers in the data scientist job market, helping them understand the market dynamics and factors influencing job popularity.  
- Project 2 is trying to classify companies as bankrupt or not based upon key financial attributes, to allow investors to make informed decisions about money investments.
